Hello and welcome! This post is currently a stub for storing the slides for my short simulated annealing presentation during an Algorithms 2 lecture. You can access the slides [here](/misc/anneal-intro.pdf).

I have also shared a Python notebook with my code on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vImfkT9Uac1CM3lf3vTKonL-gxljcU08?usp=sharing).

I will eventually fill this post with the content in the slides.
