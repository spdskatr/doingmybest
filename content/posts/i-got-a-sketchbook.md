I'm no artist, I'm a computer science student. That doesn't mean I don't like drawing, though!

I properly picked up drawing a bit less than six weeks ago and I think it's time that I got a sketchbook.

# Message from the future

> Hello! It's me from the future. It's been another six weeks since this post and, reading over some of the stuff I wrote, I do not necessarily agree with all of my points in this post anymore. Perhaps I'll write another post some other time reflecting on what I've learned.

# Why a sketchbook?

I am tremedously underqualified to tell you why you would want a sketchbook if you draw. After all, I have only done one page. So far I've enjoyed it because it's a laid-back environment where *it's okay to make mistakes*. I also don't feel as obligated to perform the act of polishing up a piece, which can be a real pain for the perfectionist inside of me (rip the Aubrey art that I never finished).

# What are you going to be doing on it?

As I was drawing the first page, I was constantly thinking to myself whether I was using my sketchbook in the "right way". Would it be somehow pointless if I were to fill every single page of this book with fan art drawn from reference?

Well, I don't think so. Drawing is my hobby. I'm drawing for fun and that's a great source of practice. Sure, I'll branch out and draw other things from time to time, but I won't force myself, because if I'm not having fun in the process, then what's the point?

# Can I see your sketches?

I've attached the first page of my exceedingly amateur sketches down below. Currently, it's just filled with my favourite video game characters (and Nim in the corner, she's just giving me support). For some of the sketches, you can even still see some of the faint construction lines I used.

You may notice that the drawing of Mari in the bottom-left is actually a study of a [t-shirt design on the OMORI merch store](https://www.omocat-shop.com/collections/omori/products/mari-t-shirt). To make things more fun, I added in the basket and finished the lower body.

I must say, upon further inspection, that hand looks off... Oh well, I don't need it to look perfect.
