# Hello!

This is my blog now. As you can tell, it's made using Hugo. I hope you enjoy your time here!

If not, that's ok. I won't be sad.

# What's next?
- Make my own theme. The [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme's pretty cool though. Thanks, [panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)!
- Add more blog posts. Hopefully showcase a bunch of projects.
