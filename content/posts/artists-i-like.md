Yay, I get to talk about my favourite artists!

# NightMargin
NightMargin made the art for the RPG OneShot, and it's how I found out about her work. Her Twitter was definitely one of the reasons I became interested in art.

Night acts silly on Twitter and sometimes accompanies it with equally silly art. Her silly artstyle is also distinct from her professional style. I *really* like the idea of having an art style exclusively for medium-effort shitposts.

It's true that this style is probably just the way she doodles, but I like to think that the doodles she posts to Twitter are exclusively memes.

Her professional work looks really clean, too! Check out the stuff she's made [here](http://nightmargin.weebly.com/).
# OMOCAT
OMOCAT (and her team of course) developed OMORI, another RPG that I'm fond of. The whole development process took 6 years and many, many restarts, but they managed to follow through.

OMOCAT's style is close (but still distinct) from anime. According to her website, her apparel brand aims to give "a way for shy individuals with vibrant personalities to express themselves". From her work, you can tell she was such a person, too! And so am I...

Anyway, I still have that small part of me that wants to develop a video game some day... It's nice to see her succeed.
# Adam Duff
I discovered Adam one day when I was browsing art YouTube. His videos typically show him working on his latest digital painting, with a voiceover giving various meditations on the artistic process.

His work is absolutely stunning, each piece is bursting with feeling. I clearly do not have the knowledge to comment on his technique - you just have to see his pieces for yourself.

Whenever I feel down or de-motivated from art, art YouTubers have given me the motivation to keep drawing. There are quite a few I watch, but he's definitely the one providing me with the most motivation.
# Honourable Mentions
- [Osulan](https://twitter.com/_osulan): One of my favourite artists in the OMORI fandom. Their animations are so fun to watch and cheer me up on sad days.
- [LavenderTowne](https://twitter.com/lavendertowne): Every aspiring artist's big sister. Supports you and draws you plenty of silly cartoons.
- [Temmie Chang](https://tuyoki.itch.io/): Artist for UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE, made her own games as well, also makes silly animations. Honestly, she deserves to be up there too but naming *three* indie RPG artists would be too obssessive. (Yeah, if you haven't gotten it by now, my creative drive is mostly fuelled by indie RPGs.)
