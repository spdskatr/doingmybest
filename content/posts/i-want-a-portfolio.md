In [the post that I had written in August](/posts/filler), I emphasised how I wanted this blog to be a place where I could write whatever was interesting to me, without needing the quality of the posts to live up to some standard. I wanted the opposite of a portfolio. Something like a sketchbook.

There's something nice about portfolios too, though.

As of writing this post, I've written ten posts in total on this blog. I don't value each post equally. I think my favourite post so far has got to be "[How Making Our ML Models Worse Helped Us Win A Datathon](/posts/datathon)", because the process of debugging code when doing data science is not something I read about a lot elsewhere, but is something that captures the true experience.

If a friend checks out this blog, they would probably want to see the cool posts more than the mundane ones, so I do want to make this sort of curated collection accessible.

Please check out the navigation links along the top! If I haven't removed it, there should be a link that says "Portfolio".

**I really appreciate you for checking out my blog.** Please don't forget, though, that I am just a person. In my portfolio, I am showcasing only the part of myself I'm most proud of and I don't want that to be the only impression you get of me, so...

Please check out my mundane posts, too.
