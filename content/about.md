Hi! I'm a Australian computer science student studying at the University of Cambridge.

It turns out, there's a lot of cool projects I work on/have worked on and thoughts I'd like to share about them. I record them here whenever I feel like there's something to write about.

I don't really specialise in anything, but I've worked on a few projects in my time.

Sometimes, I also record some of the hobbies that I have been doing outside of coding. I hope this will grow into a place where I can show a bit of my character within all of the work I produce.

I hope you enjoy your time here! If you don't, that's ok, I won't be sad. I did my best.
