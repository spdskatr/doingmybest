Hi! I'm [spdskatr](https://github.com/spdskatr), a Australian computer science student studying at the University of Cambridge.

It turns out, there's a lot of cool projects have worked on and thoughts I'd like to share about them. I record them here whenever I feel like there's something to write about.

I don't really specialise in anything.

Sometimes, I also record some of the hobbies that I have been doing outside of coding. I hope this will grow into a place where I can show a bit of my character within all of the work I produce.

I hope you enjoy your time at the Tea House!
