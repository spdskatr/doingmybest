Hi! I'm a Australian computer science student studying at the University of Cambridge.

It turns out, there's a lot of cool projects I've been working on and things I'd like to share. I'll record them here whenever I feel like writing a new post.

I don't really specialise in anything, but I've worked on a few projects in my time.

I hope you enjoy your time here! If you don't, that's ok, I won't be sad. I did my best.
