Welcome to the hall of fame! Here, I store some of my favourite posts in the entire blog. The collection is currently pretty small, but I hope that it will grow over time.

- [How Making Our ML Models Worse Helped Us Win A Datathon](/posts/datathon): This post is my favourite so far, because the process of debugging code when doing data science is not something I read about a lot elsewhere, but is something that captures the true experience.
- [The Paradox of Trying to Draw Well](/posts/paradox-of-drawing-well): This is a post that I come back to often, because the idea, although told from the perspective of learning to draw, can also be applied to some other skill-based tasks.
