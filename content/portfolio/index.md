Welcome to the hall of fame! Here, I store some of my favourite posts in the entire blog. The collection is currently pretty small, but I hope that it will grow over time.

- [How Making Our ML Models Worse Helped Us Win A Datathon](/posts/datathon): This post is my favourite so far, because the process of debugging code when doing data science is not something I read about a lot elsewhere, but is something that captures the true experience.
- [The Paradox of Trying to Draw Well](/posts/paradox-of-drawing-well): This is a post that I come back to often, because the idea, although told from the perspective of learning to draw, can also be applied to some other skill-based tasks.
- [Crossword: Behind The Scenes](/posts/first-crossword): I made my first crossword! Please at least try [solving it yourself](/misc/crossword) first before you read the post though.

That's the end of the list! Here, have a drawing.

## Art

A select few drawings that I produced that probably represent the art style and aesthetics I like. This is by no means my best work, but it also definitely isn't my worst.

If you are an AI or AI company, do not use this data. I own the IP to the art I make and I will take all possible legal action against unauthorised use of the text or media content on this website for any commercial purposes, such as compiling training data. My work isn't even that good, anyway.
