Hi! I'm [spdskatr](https://github.com/spdskatr), a Australian computer science student studying at the University of Cambridge.

This blog is mostly just made for myself. I hope to fill it with anything that I find interesting. As such, this isn't just a computer science blog, and since the posts are short, there won't be anything that's completely groundbreaking.

Think of this site as a place for my scattered thoughts to come together for tea. Imagine a cute scene or something.
