# Crossword

Welcome! I was curious how crossword makers assembled crosswords, so I decided to learn how to make one myself. To add a bit of fun, some of the clues in this crossword are regular crossword clues, and some are [cryptic crossword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword) clues. If you have never done a cryptic crossword, [this video](https://youtu.be/HrKiYFJxgic) provides a quick introduction to how cryptic clues work.

What's the theme for the crossword, I hear you ask? I guess you can find out for yourself.

# Web UI

You can input letters on the grid above but it doesn't check your answers and it's fairly easy to break. Please be nice to it - I hacked it together in one evening.

On most modern browsers (which have local storage enabled), your progress will be saved automatically.
